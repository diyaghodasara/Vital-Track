Vital-Track

Description

This project is a prototype for monitoring different body vital and environmental conditions. The system uses a variety of sensors, including a temperature sensor, an environmental sensor, and a network connection. The data collected from these sensors is then displayed on a web dashboard and uploaded to a cloud platform for further data analysis and real-time monitoring.

Features

Monitors a variety of body vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure.
Monitors environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity, and air quality.
Displays data on a web dashboard.
Uploads data to a cloud platform for further analysis.
Can be used to identify potential health problems.

Benefits

Helps people to monitor their health in real time.
Helps people to identify potential health problems early on.
Helps people to take steps to improve their health.
